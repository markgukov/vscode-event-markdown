# README

A Visual Studio Code extension that adds language support for Event Markdown (https://github.com/Adaptech/les), which let's you build complete CQRS/ES systems straight from Event Storming.

## Features

Currently it adds simple syntax highlighting.

## Requirements

The color theme has to be set to Monokai.

## Installation

Since the extension hasn't been published yet, to load it you need to copy the files to your VS Code extensions directory. Depending on your platform, it is located in the following directories:

* Windows `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
* Mac `~/.vscode/extensions`
* Linux `~/.vscode/extensions`

## Known Issues

* The extension is using Monokai-specific color names/scopes.
* The #events regex pattern reference has to be last.
